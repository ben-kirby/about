export const about = 'After graduating from Portland State University in 2015 I began working in the tech industry for an iPad-based Point of Sale developer. While there, I was able to get some good exposure to the development world working alongside our QA team and by developing tools for our customer care team to speed up their workflows. I was really enjoying the development work that I was doing so I decided to take Epicodus\' Intro to Programming course in the evenings. By the time the class was finished, I was hooked. A few months later I left my job to enroll in the full-time program. When I\'m not coding, you can find me cooking for my friends, pestering my cat Miso while he tries to nap, and tracking down a good beer. Sometimes all at the same time.';
